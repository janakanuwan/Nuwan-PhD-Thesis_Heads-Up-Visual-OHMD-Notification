Notifications can distract users from ongoing tasks, presenting a research challenge in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). This thesis investigates reducing the attention costs of notifications on Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays (OST-HMD, OHMD, or augmented reality smart glasses), a potential successor to mobile phones. Incorporating visual perception properties, the thesis proposes using paracentral and near-peripheral regions, transforming text into graphics, and adjusting the luminance of notification content. These methods, evaluated through user studies, contribute to the development of attention-preserving visualizations for OHMDs. Results suggest that modifying the OHMD notification presentation can provide secondary information with less distraction. This approach addresses existing challenges in the heads-up computing paradigm and offers valuable design implications.
